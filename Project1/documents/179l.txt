Irish duo could block Man Utd bid Irishmen <name>JP</name> <name>McManus</name> and <name>John</name> <name>Magnier,</name> who own a 29% stake in Manchester United, will reportedly reject any formal £800m offer for the club. The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal £800m takeover bid from US tycoon <name>Malcom</name> <name>Glazer.</name> <name>Mr</name> <name>Glazer</name> got permission to look at the club's accounts last week. Irish billionaires <name>Mr</name> <name>McManus</name> and <name>Mr</name> <name>Magnier</name> are said to believe that an £800m bid undervalues club prospects. <name>Mr</name> <name>Magnier</name> and <name>Mr</name> <name>McManus,</name> who hold their stake through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid. <name>Mr</name> <name>Glazer's</name> financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they won't back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club's shares. However, there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough. <name>Mr</name> <name>Glazer</name> has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003. <name>Mr</name> <name>Magnier</name> and <name>Mr</name> <name>McManus</name> issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained "long-term investors" in Man Utd. The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.
