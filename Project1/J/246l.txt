His lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan.</name> However, on Monday <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan</name> named <name>Mr</name> <name>Ebbers</name> as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud. "He [Ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information," <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan</name> told a New York court. On his first day of questioning, <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan</name> admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements. "We did not disclose these adjustments," he said. "We did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false." <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan</name> said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as "detail-oriented". He portrayed <name>Mr</name> <name>Ebbers,</name> a charismatic businessman who built up WorldCom from a small regional operator into one of America's largest telecoms firms, as obsessed with costs. "He would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home," he said. "We needed to cut expenses. We needed to cut a lot more than coffee expenses." <name>Mr</name> <name>Sullivan</name> is at the centre of the government's case against <name>Mr</name> <name>Ebbers.</name> <name>Mr</name> <name>Ebbers</name> could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.
