## Project 3: Entity matching.

- Matching Fodors and Zagats

  -  the user ID that you used to log into the CloudMatcher cluster. 
    
     groupten

  -  the project ID that you used to create a project in which you matched the two tables Fodors and Zagats. 

     trialrun

  -  a screenshot of the very last screen after you are done with the matches. Here is an example of such a screen.

- Blocking Results

  - the user ID that you used to log into CloudMatcher
  
    groupten

  - the project ID that you used to create a project in which you blocked and matched the two tables A and B
  
    bookmatch

  - a screen shot of the top ten blocking rules that CloudMatcher has learned

- Matching Results

  - the user ID that you used to log into CloudMatcher
  
    groupten

- Estimating accuracy

  - Provide a link to the files "Prediction list", "Candidate set", "Table A", and "Table B" that you have downloaded from CloudMatcher. 
  
    Prediction list: https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/prediction.xls
    
    Table A: https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/tableA.xls
    
    Table B: https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/tableB.xls
    
    Candidate set is too large (more than 100 MB) to be uploaded
    
  - List the size of the candidate set C.
   
    1398101
  
  - Provide a pdf file that discusses each iteration of computing density of the matches and using new blocking rules to reduce the candidate set size. 
  
    https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/block.pdf

  - provide link to where your blocking code is. 
  
    https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/block.py
       
  - provide link to the final reduced set of candidate tuple pairs. 
  
    https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/candidateafterblock.csv
        
  - provide link to the set of 400 tuple pairs that you have sampled and manually labeled. 
      
    https://github.com/zachary62/CS-838/blob/master/Project3/label.csv
     
  - list the precision and recall you have obtained using the above 400 tuple pairs and the Jupyter notebook. 
  
    Precision: [0.6838887462607022, 0.9388903151707551]
